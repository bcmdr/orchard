# Orchard

Orchard is home to your tree.
Your tree wants to help you build better habits.
Start by telling your tree something you'd like to do every day.
Your tree grows a fruit each day you do that particular thing.
Be sure to check back on successful days to collect your fruit.
If you miss a day, don't worry. Just try again the next day.
The more fruit you collect, the better you'll feel.
Your tree is waiting. Help it help you.
Best of luck!
